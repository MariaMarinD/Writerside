<p>RX1‐1A, RX2‐1A and RX3‐1A logs are the traveltime from the transmitter to the receivers. Each of these receivers are 0.2 m apart. A Velocity Analysis log is used to determine the slowness of P and S waves from the measurements of the multi receiver sonic probe (Figure 1).</p>

<p>Using the distance from the transmitter to receiver and the sonic information 
from the three receivers, an algorithm creates fan lines with different slopes
(Figure 1). Each slope is the ratio of time to distance (us/m) and coherence 
values. The results of this process is an array of values which are the
correlation between each of the receivers for a slope of fitted lines for each depth 
position. These logs can be represented in three different ways:</p>

<format style="italic" color="Black">Figure 2. Example of FWS plot on WellCAD</format>

<p>The first two logs are more typical representations of the output data (Figure 2). 
The darker bands indicate a high correlation of the signal amplitudes at certain
slowness values. As the P‐wave arrives before the S‐wave, interpretation of the 
first high correlation band is usually generated by the P‐wave amplitude.</p>

<p>P and S wave slowness are calculated by the interval transit time of the P‐wave
between receivers with a known distance. This can also be calculated using the correlation 
log (VDL) and picking the first and second correlation maximum. P and S wave velocity 
is calculated from the P and S wave slowness.</p>

<format style="bold" color="Orange">VDL</format>

<p>The VDL is a representation of full waveform sonic or full wave display. Also called 
Micro Seismogram (MSG by Halliburton) it is commonly referred to as Variable
Density Log (VDL by Schlumberger). Full wave form sonic contains four basic properties:
(1) arrival time,(2) amplitude, (3) amplitude attenuation and (4) the
frequency. It also contains information about three waves; P, S and tube waves. 
The goal of the processing is to enhance the amplitude of signal arrivals of these 
three types of waves. VDL image is obtained by coding the positive and the negative
signal of waveform. The best way to view a VDL is to shade the positive amplitude of 
wave during the processing. In WellCAD, these displays can be creating in full colour,
grey scale, or green/yellow shades (Figure 3).</p>

<p>The VDL image can be represented in grey scale, the variation in shading is related
to the changes in amplitude in the waveform. In grey scale there are three colours; 
white, grey and black. The white represents high amplitude negative wave pulses, grey
low amplitude waves and black represents high amplitude positive pulse.</p>

<p>DGI displays the VDL image in colour but the interpretation is the same. There are 
four major colours; blue, green, yellow and red. The colour indicates the strength of 
the amplitude; the high amplitude is in red and the low amplitude is in blue or purple.</p>

<format style="bold" color="Orange">PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES</format>

<p>DGI delivers Physical and Mechanical Rock Properties by combining sonic and density
data. Sonic logs reflect the acoustic properties of a formation. The variable density 
log (VDL) is derived from the computed correlation between each of the probe
receivers. The P‐wave and S‐wave slowness are determined from the VDL.</p>

<p>P‐wave and S‐wave slowness, in conjunction with density results, are used to 
calculate five mechanical and elastic properties: Poisson’s Ratio, Shear modulus,
Young’s modulus, Bulk modulus and Bulk compressibility. These are useful for multiple
geotechnical purposes (Figure 4).</p>
